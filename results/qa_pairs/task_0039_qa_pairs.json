It was first published by the British magazine Horizon in 1947, and addresses many of the social and intellectual issues faced by African Americans in the early 20th century, including black nationalism, the relationship between black identity and Marxism, and the reformist racial policies of Booker T. Washington, as well as issues of individuality and personal identity.\nInvisible Man won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction in 1953, making Ellison the first African-American writer to win the award.\nIn 1998, the Modern Library ranked Invisible Man 19th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.
